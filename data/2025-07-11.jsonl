To better understand the physical origin of this pressure-induced\nphenomenon, here we have studied the structural, electronic, and magnetic\nproperties of undoped and O-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi2212) under\npressures based on density-functional theory calculations. We first identified\nthe crystal structure of undoped Bi2212 with the armchair distortions in the\nBiO layers and reproduced the insulating feature of the parent compound. Then\nwe added an extra O atom to the parent compound to simulate the hole-doping\neffect and found that the structure with O dopant located in the van der Waals\n(vdW) gap is energetically the most stable. Further calculations on O-doped\n(0.125 holes/Cu) Bi2212 revealed that the pressure can induce charge\nredistributions between CuO$_2$ planes and BiO layers; specifically,\nCu-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals gain electrons and Cu atoms rather than O atoms\ndominate around the Fermi level under high pressure. Along with the increasing\npressure, the density of states at the Fermi level first reaches the maximum at\n$\\sim$ 10 GPa and then shows a valley near the Fermi level above 20 GPa, which\nmay be responsible for the insulatinglike state observed in recent experiments.\nWe suggest that the competition among several factors, such as the increase of\nelectrons in the CuO$_2$ plane, the variation of in-plane hopping due to the\nshortened Cu-O distance, and the enhanced Coulomb repulsion among the Cu-3$d$\nelectrons, could lead to the exotic transition under pressure. Our work\nprovides an explanation of the high-pressure behaviors of Bi2212, which may\nfacilitate a comprehensive understanding of cuprate superconductors."}
