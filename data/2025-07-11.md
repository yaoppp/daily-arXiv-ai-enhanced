TL;DR: 多切片电子衍射成像技术（MEP）实现了对三维半导体器件中原子尺度特征的成像，揭示了界面粗糙度和应变松弛等性能限制因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代半导体器件需要原子尺度计量学来解决纳米级制造挑战，但现有X射线和电子显微镜技术无法同时满足高分辨率和深度信息的需求。

Method: 采用多切片电子衍射成像技术（MEP），结合亚埃级横向分辨率和纳米级深度分辨率，对全环绕栅极晶体管进行三维成像。

Result: 研究发现硅通道中的原子逐渐松弛，仅60%保持体结构；界面粗糙度因加工条件不同而异，这些因素直接影响载流子迁移率。

Conclusion: MEP技术为建模和早期制造优化提供了关键的实验数据，解决了原子尺度三维成像的难题。

Abstract: To improve transistor density and electronic performance, next-generation
semiconductor devices are adopting three-dimensional architectures and feature
sizes down to the few-nm regime, which require atomic-scale metrology to
identify and resolve performance-limiting fabrication challenges. X-ray methods
deliver three-dimensional imaging of integrated circuits but lack the spatial
resolution to characterize atomic-scale features, while conventional electron
microscopy offers atomic-scale imaging but limited depth information. We
demonstrate how multislice electron ptychography (MEP), a computational
electron microscopy technique with sub-\r{A}ngstr\"om lateral and
nanometer-scale depth resolution, enables 3D imaging of buried features in
devices. By performing MEP on prototype gate-all-around transistors we uncover
and quantify distortions and defects at the interface of the 3D gate oxide
wrapped around the channel. We find that the silicon in the 5-nm-thick channel
gradually relaxes away from the interfaces, leaving only 60% of the atoms in a
bulk-like structure. Quantifying the interface roughness, which was not
previously possible for such small 3D structures but strongly impacts carrier
mobility, we find that the top and bottom interfaces show different
atomic-scale roughness profiles, reflecting their different processing
conditions. By measuring 3D interface roughness simultaneously with strain
relaxation and atomic-scale defects, from a single MEP dataset, we provide
direct experimental values of these performance-limiting parameters needed for
modeling and early fabrication optimization.

### [2] [Exact Solutions for Bimodal Distributions under Stochastic Plasma Irradiation in Thin Films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07268)
*Joel Saucedo,Uday Lamba,Hasitha Mahabaduge*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个精确解析理论，解决了等离子体辐照薄膜中双峰晶粒分布和标度律的理论矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型无法统一噪声驱动演化、缺陷饱和动力学和成核-损失平衡，导致理论矛盾。

Method: 开发了精确解析理论，推导了稳态晶粒面积分布，并确定了双峰性起点的无量纲阈值。

Result: 建立了普适的标度律，揭示了随机碰撞与确定性生长之间的竞争如何触发微结构破碎。

Conclusion: 该理论框架解决了长期存在的辐照诱导表面演化问题，为材料加工提供了预测基础。

Abstract: A persistent paradox complicates the study of plasma-irradiated thin films,
where bimodal grain distributions and ambiguous scaling laws, roughly shifting
between $\Phi^{-1/2}$ and $\Phi^{-1}$, or a general inverse dependence on
plasma flux, are empirical yet remain theoretically unreconciled. Existing
models fail to unify noise-driven evolution, defect saturation kinetics, and
nucleation-loss balance within a single, self-consistent formalism. This work
resolves these discrepancies by developing the first exact analytical theory
for this system. We derive the closed-form steady-state grain area
distribution, $P_{ss}(A)$, establish the precise dimensionless threshold for
bimodality onset at $\Pi_c = 4/(3\sqrt{3})$, and demonstrate that defect
saturation physics mandate a universal $\langle A \rangle \propto \kappa^2
\Phi^{-1} e^{+2E_b/k_B T_s}$ scaling law. The framework reveals how competition
between stochastic impingement and deterministic growth triggers microstructure
fragmentation, resolving long-standing ambiguities in irradiation-induced
surface evolution and providing a predictive foundation for materials
processing.

### [3] [Stabilization of the first-order phase transition character and Enhancement of the Electrocaloric Effect by NBT substitution in BaTiO$_3$ ceramics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07290)
*M. Karakaya,I. Gurbuz,L. Fulanovic,U. Adem*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 研究了BaTiO3基无铅铁电材料的电热性能，发现增加Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3含量可增强BaTiO3的四方性，从而维持一级相变特性并获得较大的电热响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过调控材料组成实现大的电热响应，特别是在BaTiO3基材料中。

Method: 研究了不同Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3含量的(1−x)BaTiO3−xNa0.5Bi0.5TiO3陶瓷，通过直接和间接测量评估电热性能。

Result: x=0.20的组分在40 kV/cm电场下获得了约1.65 K的有效电热温度变化。

Conclusion: 增加Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3含量可优化BaTiO3基材料的电热性能，维持一级相变特性是关键。

Abstract: The electrocaloric properties of BaTiO$_3$-based lead-free ferroelectric
materials have been widely investigated. One approach to achieving a large
electrocaloric response is to exploit the substantial polarization change
associated with the first-order phase transition at the Curie temperature.
Following this strategy, we investigated the electrocaloric response of
(1$-x$)BaTiO$_3$-$x$Na$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$ (BT-NBT) ceramics for x = 0.05,
0.10, 0.20, and 0.30. In this BT-rich region of the solid solution, it is
established that increasing the NBT content enhances the tetragonality of
BaTiO$_3$. We show that this increase in tetragonality helps maintain the
first-order nature of the phase transition and enables a correspondingly large
electrocaloric response, despite the simultaneous enhancement of relaxor
ferroelectric character with NBT substitution. A significantly large effective
electrocaloric temperature change ($\Delta T_{\mathrm{eff}}$) of ~1.65 K was
obtained for the x = 0.20 composition under an applied field of 40 kV/cm using
direct electrocaloric measurements, in reasonable agreement with the indirect
results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学和材料科学的研究需求日益增长，知识量和实验工作量不断扩大，需要ML来加速研究效率。

Method: 1. 使用LLMs（LMExt工具）自动化提取化学信息；2. 训练CatBoost算法的ML模型预测热力学参数。

Result: LMExt成功提取了多种数据（如稳定性常数、热力学性质等）；ML模型能准确预测矿物热力学参数。

Conclusion: 综合ML方法具有重塑化学和材料科学研究的潜力。

Abstract: New discoveries in chemistry and materials science, with increasingly
expanding volume of requisite knowledge and experimental workload, provide
unique opportunities for machine learning (ML) to take critical roles in
accelerating research efficiency. Here, we demonstrate (1) the use of large
language models (LLMs) for automated literature reviews, and (2) the training
of an ML model to predict chemical knowledge (thermodynamic parameters). Our
LLM-based literature review tool (LMExt) successfully extracted chemical
information and beyond into a machine-readable structure, including stability
constants for metal cation-ligand interactions, thermodynamic properties, and
other broader data types (medical research papers, and financial reports),
effectively overcoming the challenges inherent in each domain. Using the
autonomous acquisition of thermodynamic data, an ML model was trained using the
CatBoost algorithm for accurately predicting thermodynamic parameters (e.g.,
enthalpy of formation) of minerals. This work highlights the transformative
potential of integrated ML approaches to reshape chemistry and materials
science research.

### [5] [High thermal conductivity dominated by thermal phonons with mean free paths exceeding hundred nanometer in three-dimensional covalent organic framework derivatives: a molecular dynamics study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07386)
*Sungjae Kim,Taeyong Kim*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 研究通过分子动力学模拟分析了3D COF衍生物的热传输特性，发现高密度COF-102衍生物的热导率可达27 W/mK，揭示了低频声子模式在热传导中的主导作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共价有机框架（COFs）的热性能因其优异的热传导特性而备受关注，但微观过程的研究有限。

Method: 使用分子动力学模拟研究了六种不同有机连接体和拓扑结构的COF-102衍生物。

Result: 高密度的COF-102衍生物热导率高达27 W/mK，低频声子模式是热传导的主要载体。

Conclusion: 研究为COFs的热传导结构-性能关系提供了理论框架，为热管理应用提供了设计策略。

Abstract: Thermal properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of fundamental
interest owing to exceptional heat conduction properties. Recent studies have
suggested that their thermal conductivities can be enhanced by multiple factors
such as pore size, mass density, and degree of chain order. However,
microscopic processes that govern heat conduction properties have been explored
in only a limited number of COFs. Here, we report thermal transport properties
of 3D COF derivatives using molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, we
have studied six different COF-102 derivatives with different organic linkers
and topologies. Among the derivatives studied, we found that COF-102
derivatives with high mass density can exhibit thermal conductivity as high as
~ 27 W/mK, owing to suppressed chain rotation that leads to thermal phonons
scattered by anharmonicity. Our results show that the observed orders of
magnitude of increase in the thermal conductivity are primarily attributed to
low frequency phonon modes that support hundreds of nanometer scale mean free
path, which predominantly carry heat. Our study provides a theoretical
framework that elucidates the structure-property relationship governing heat
conduction in COFs, offering design strategies for thermal management
applications.

### [6] [Pressure Induced Altermagnetism in Layered Ternary Iron-Selenides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11228)

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 通过第一性原理计算，重新研究了空位有序铁硒化物A2Fe4Se5的高压相，发现磁相变和绝缘体-金属转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高压下空位有序铁硒化物的磁性和电子结构变化，探索其潜在的超导性质。

Method: 采用第一性原理计算，分析高压下A2Fe4Se5的磁相变和电子结构。

Result: 观察到从块自旋反铁磁相到Neel-AM相的一级相变，伴随c轴塌缩和绝缘体-金属转变。Neel-AM相是一种罕见的内在交替磁性，自旋分裂达300 meV。

Conclusion: 高压下Neel-AM相可能是KyFe2-xSe2再入超导相的母态，支持等自旋三重态配对。

Abstract: Employing first-principles based calculations, we reexamined the
high-pressure phases of the vacancy-ordered iron-selenides, i.e. A2Fe4Se5
phase. A magnetic transition from the block-spin antiferromagnetic phase to
Neel-AM phase is observed under high pressure when the iron-vacancy order is
preserved. The transition is first-order, driven by the collapse of c-axis and
accompanied by an insulator-metal transition. In addition, the Neel-AM phase is
a rare example of intrinsic altermagnetism that does not require ligand atoms
nor supercell construction to break the spatial inversion or translational
symmetry between the two spin sublattices, with a spin-splitting of the band
structure as large as 300 meV. If the re-entrant superconducting phase of
KyFe2-xSe2 under high pressure emerges from the Neel-AM normal state, an
equal-spin triplet pairing would be naturally favored.

### [7] [Promising ferroelectric metal EuAuBi with switchable giant shift current](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07403)

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 论文通过第一性原理计算发现拓扑半金属EuAuBi具有巨大的自发极化、适中的切换势垒和低载流子浓度，同时表现出显著的体光伏效应，为铁电金属的研究提供了新思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索铁电金属的共存特性及其在电子和光电子系统中的新功能，解决其稀有性和挑战性问题。

Method: 使用第一性原理计算分析EuAuBi的自发极化、切换势垒、载流子浓度及电子-声子耦合，并研究其体光伏效应。

Result: EuAuBi表现出16.6-20.2 μC/cm²的自发极化、68.5 meV/f.u.的切换势垒和低载流子浓度，且具有显著的体光伏效应（370 μA/V²）。

Conclusion: EuAuBi是一种有前景的铁电金属，研究为铁电金属的识别提供了实用方法，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: The coexistence of metallicity and ferroelectricity in ferroelectric (FE)
metals defies conventional wisdom and enables novel functionalities in
electronic and optoelectronic systems. However, intrinsic FE metals remain
extremely rare and challenging. Here, using first-principles calculations, we
identify that a huge spontaneous polarization of 16.6-20.2
$\mu\text{C}/\text{cm}^2$, a moderate switching barrier of 68.5 meV/f.u., and a
low carrier concentration of $ \sim 2.5 \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ coexist in
topological semimetal EuAuBi. Further electron-phonon coupling calculations
reveal that the metallic carriers interact weakly with the FE phonon mode,
consistent with the decoupled electron mechanism. Moreover, EuAuBi exhibits a
pronounced bulk photovoltaic effect characterized by a giant
polarization-dependent shift current with the magnitude of conductivity up to
370 $\mu\text{A}/\text{V}^2$. Thus, a feasible FE metal verification setup is
proposed based on the shift current measurement. These results not only
demonstrate that EuAuBi is a promising FE metal, but also propose a practical
route for FE metals identification, which could promote the FE metals study
greatly.

TL;DR: Fe$_3$Ga$_4$薄膜在室温低磁场下表现出大拓扑反常霍尔效应（UAHE），为自旋电子器件提供了潜在候选材料。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻找在低磁场和室温下表现出波动驱动标量自旋手性（SSC）和UAHE的新材料，以解决现有材料依赖低温或高磁场的限制。

Method: 通过外延生长Fe$_3$Ga$_4$薄膜，研究其场诱导横向锥形螺旋相驱动的SSC和UAHE。

Result: Fe$_3$Ga$_4$薄膜在室温低磁场下表现出大UAHE。

Conclusion: Fe$_3$Ga$_4$薄膜是自旋电子器件的理想候选材料，因其在室温低磁场下稳定的大UAHE。

Abstract: Noncoplanar spin textures usually exhibit a finite scalar spin chirality
(SSC) that can generate effective magnetic fields and lead to additional
contributions to the Hall effect, namely topological or unconventional
anomalous Hall effect (UAHE). Unlike topological spin textures (e.g., magnetic
skyrmions), materials that exhibit fluctuation-driven SSC and UAHE are rare. So
far, their realization has been limited to either low temperatures or high
magnetic fields, both of which are unfavorable for practical applications.
Identifying new materials that exhibit UAHE in a low magnetic field at room
temperature is therefore essential. Here, we report the discovery of a large
UAHE far above room temperature in epitaxial Fe$_3$Ga$_4$ films, where the
fluctuation-driven SSC stems from the field-induced transverse-conical-spiral
phase. Considering their epitaxial nature and the large UAHE stabilized at room
temperature in a low magnetic field, Fe$_3$Ga$_4$ films represent an exciting,
albeit rare, case of a promising candidate material for spintronic devices.

Abstract: In this work, we reveal the coexistence and correlation of a topological cusp
anomaly in the planar Hall signal and a spin-flip scattering dominated positive
longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR) across the entire temperature range below
the Curie point in Fe3GeTe2. This correlation dies out exponentially as the
magnetic field is directed away from the ab-plane, resulting in unusually sharp
polar angle dependence of longitudinal MR and the Hall response.

Motivation: 探索锂铌酸铁中导电畴壁（CDWs）的标准化制备及其电学特性，以解决其在纳米电子学应用中的随机性问题。

Method: 采用原位时间分辨二次谐波显微技术（SHG），监测畴壁在电压增强过程中的动态变化，重构其三维形状。

Conclusion: 畴壁导电性的起源需重新评估，点缺陷的作用不可忽视，这对未来纳米电子学设计有重要启示。

Abstract: Conductive domain walls (CDWs) in the uniaxial ferroelectric lithium niobate
(LiNbO$_3$, LN) have attracted a lot of interest as potential elements in 2D
nanoelectronics, due to their orders-of-magnitude larger electronic AC and DC
conductivities as compared to the host material. On the way towards generating
standardized CDWs into z-cut bulk LN crystals with controllable geometry and
electrical properties, we have encountered setbacks recently: Although the
first preparation step, i.e., the established UV-light-assisted
liquid-electrode poling, reliably creates fully penetrating hexagonal domains
with the DWs being aligned almost parallel to the polarization axis, the second
step in the DW 'conductivity-enhancement' process through post-growth voltage
ramping, resulted in randomly-shaped DWs as reflected in their different
current-voltage (I-V) characteristics even after having applied the same
process parameters. To clarify this phenomenon, we present here an
\textit{in-situ} and time-resolved second-harmonic-generation (SHG) microscopy
investigation of DW samples of different sizes, monitoring the DW evolution
during that critical voltage ramping, which allowed us to reconstruct the 3D DW
shapes both prior to and after the enhancement process. As a result, we are
able to map the temporal changes of the local DW inclination angle $\alpha$,
and to quantify the DW velocity. As a consequence, we need to re-assess and
re-think the origin of the DW conductivity (DWC) in LN: The hitherto assumed
simple connection between $\alpha$ and the DWC can not be generalized, since
point defects accumulating along DWs act as extra sources for charge carrier
trapping/release, significantly contributing to the DW current.

Abstract: Interfacial polarization-charge accumulation at the heterointerface-is a
well-established tool in semiconductors, but its influence in metals remains
unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that interfacial polarization can robustly
modulate surface work function in metallic rutile RuO2 layers in epitaxial
RuO2/TiO2 heterostructures grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. Using
multislice electron ptychography, we directly visualize polar displacements of
transition metal ions relative to oxygen octahedra near the interface, despite
the conductive nature of RuO2. This interfacial polarization enables over 1 eV
modulation of the RuO2 work function, controlled by small thickness variation
(2-4 nm) as measured by Kelvin probe probe microscopy, with a critical
thickness of 4 nm - corresponding to the transition from fully strained to
relaxed film. These results establish interfacial polarization as a powerful
route to control electronic properties in metals and have implications for
designing tunable electronic, catalytic, and quantum devices through
interfacial control in polar metallic systems.

Abstract: Oxygen vacancies are critical for determining the electrochemical performance
of fast oxygen ion conductors. The perovskite La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$CoO$_3$,
known for its excellent mixed ionic-electronic conduction, has attracted
significant attention due to its favorable vacancy characteristics. In this
study, we employ first-principles calculations to systematically investigate
the impact of 3$d$ transition-metal doping on the oxygen vacancy formation
energies in the perovskite. Two magnetic states, namely the ferromagnetic and
paramagnetic states, are considered in our models to capture the influence of
magnetic effects on oxygen vacancy energetics. Our results reveal that the
oxygen vacancy formation energies are strongly dependent on both the dopant
species and the magnetic state. Notably, the magnetic states alter the vacancy
formation energy in a dopant-specific manner due to double exchange
interactions, indicating that relying solely on the ferromagnetic ground state
may result in misleading trends in doping behavior. These findings emphasise
the importance of accounting for magnetic effects when investigating oxygen
vacancy properties in perovskite oxides.

Motivation: 探讨铁电体中电极化调制与二次谐波强度调制的关系，揭示传统假设ΔP∝ΔISH在特定条件下不成立的原因。

Method: 使用非线性响应理论推导时间域表达式，并通过电子铁电体模型的实时模拟验证理论预测。

Result: 发现ΔISH不仅依赖于电场，还受其时间导数影响，且可能与ΔP反相，表明传统关系ΔP∝ΔISH在特定条件下不成立。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了非线性动力学极化率的复数值和频率依赖性，挑战了传统假设，为铁电体非线性光学响应提供了新见解。

Abstract: We revisit the relationship between electric polarization modulation $\Delta
P$ in ferroelectrics induced by a low-frequency pulsed electric field and the
corresponding second harmonic intensity modulation $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$.
Using nonlinear response theory, we derive their time-domain expressions linear
in the pulse amplitude, revealing that not only the electric field but also its
time derivative contributes to $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Furthermore, even when
the time-derivative component is negligible, $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can be in
antiphase with the pulsed field and thus with $\Delta P$. These theoretical
predictions are further supported by real-time simulations of a model for
electronic ferroelectrics. Our results demonstrate that the commonly assumed
relation $\Delta P \propto \Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can break down under certain
conditions, reflecting the complex-valued and frequency-dependent nature of
nonlinear dynamical susceptibilities.

Abstract: Topological nodal line semimetals (NLSMs) represent an intriguing quantum
phase, opening new avenues in materials science for practical applications such
as anisotropic transport devices, high-mobility conductors, unconventional
thermoelectrics, and nonlinear optical devices. Recently, Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ has
been theoretically proposed as a type-II NLSM, with its Fermi surface
containing only one nodal ring. Here, we demonstrate how uniaxial,
equi-biaxial, and equi-triaxial strains affect the nodal line state of the
$Imm2$-phase of Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ by using state-of-the-art ab-initio calculations.
Under the application of uniaxial compressive strain (UCS) along the
a-direction, the plane of the nodal line evolves from the $k_x$-$k_z$ to
$k_y$-$k_z$ for 6\%$\leq$UCS$\leq$8\%. In contrast, under uniaxial tensile
strain (UTS), the nodal line remains in the ($k_x$-$k_z$) plane across the
entire studied range of UTS. Interestingly, on the application of equi-biaxial
tensile strain (EBTS) along a-b (a-c) directions, it hosts only one nodal ring
below 8\% ($<$6\%), which further evolves into three (seven) nodal-ring for
EBTS of 8\% (6\%$\leq$EBTS$\leq$8\%). Upon the application of EBTS along a-c
directions, we found two sets of three mutually orthogonal, intersecting nodal
loops (topological gimbals). Apart from this, under the application of
equi-biaxial compressive strain (EBCS) along the a-b (a-c) directions, it
exhibits only one nodal ring up to 8\% (7\%). Beyond this, the nodal line
completely vanishes and does not reappear at higher values of EBCS. Under
equi-triaxial tensile strain (ETTS), Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ exhibits only one nodal-ring
$<$6\%, which subsequently transforms into five nodal-ring for
6\%$\leq$ETTS$\leq$8\%. However, under the application of equi-triaxial
compressive strain (ETCS), as in EBCS, only one nodal line exists up to 6\%
ETCS.

Motivation: 探索硼烯作为超低摩擦材料的潜力，并与hBN直接比较摩擦性能。

Method: 在超高真空室温下进行实验，结合Prandtl-Tomlinson模型和从头计算，分析摩擦性能。

Result: 硼烯表现出超低摩擦，hBN为低摩擦材料；硼烯的摩擦更低源于其与探针的相互作用较弱。

Conclusion: 硼烯具有低摩擦特性，横向异质结构研究为直接比较二维材料性能提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The tribological performance of 2D materials makes them good candidates
toward a reduction of friction at the macroscale. Superlubricity has been
observed for graphene, MoS\textsubscript{2} and MXenes and hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) is used to reduce or tune friction, but other materials are
investigated as potential candidates for low-lubricity applications.
Specifically, borophene is predicted to have ultra-low friction. Here, we
experimentally investigate frictional properties of borophene and use a
borophene-hBN lateral heterostructure to directly compare the tribological
properties of the two complementary 2D materials. In particular, we investigate
the friction between a sliding tip and (i) the weakly corrugated
$\mathcal{X}_6$-borophene layer on Ir(111) or (ii) the hBN/Ir(111) superlattice
structures with a strongly corrugated moir\'e reconstruction. Our experimental
study performed in ultra-high vacuum at room temperature combined with a
Prandtl-Tomlinson (PT) model calculation confirms the superlubricity predicted
for borophene, while hBN, which exhibits a higher friction, is nevertheless
confirmed as a low friction material. Ab initio calculations show that the
lower friction of $\mathcal{X}_6$-borophene with respect to hBN can be
rationalized by weaker tip/surface interactions. In addition, we assess
structural and electrical properties of borophene and hBN by using scanning
probe techniques and compare their dissipation under the oscillating tip to
investigate the possible path of energy dissipation occurring during friction.
Our study demonstrates the low frictional properties of borophene and the
potential of lateral heterostructure investigations to directly compare the
properties of these 2D materials.

Abstract: Local strain engineering is a promising technique to tune the properties of
two-dimensional materials at the nanoscale. However, many existing methods are
static and limit the systematic exploration of strain-dependent material
behavior. Here, we demonstrate dynamic and reversible control of local strain
distributions in suspended trilayer tungsten disulfide ($\mathrm{WS}_2$) via
nanoindentation using a micro-mechanical spring patterned with nanoscale
probes. Micro-photoluminescence measurements reveal that indentation using a
ring-shaped probe induces a nearly uniform biaxial strain distribution
accompanied by a reversible redshift of the neutral exciton peak, consistent
with simulated strain magnitudes. We further show that the in-plane strain
distribution is spatially programmable by engineering the probe geometry and
present designs for inducing point-like, uniaxial, biaxial, and triaxial strain
distributions. The presented platform enables substrate-free, repeatable local
strain engineering in suspended 2D materials and provides a versatile tool for
streamlining the investigation of strain-dependent phenomena.

Result: 高温低氧条件下制备的多晶LGPO薄膜离子电导率最高（1.2×10^-5 S cm^-1），优于LiPON。

Conclusion: LGPO是一种高性能固态电解质，适用于下一代微型电池架构。

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries employing solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are emerging
as a safer and more compact alternative to conventional batteries using liquid
electrolytes, especially for miniaturized energy storage systems. However, the
industry-standard SSE, LiPON, imposes limitations due to its incompatibility
with high-temperature processing. In this study, we investigate
Li$_{4-x}$Ge$_{1-x}$P$_x$O$_4$ (LGPO), a LISICON-type oxide, as a promising
alternative thin-film SSE. LGPO thin films are fabricated using pulsed laser
deposition under four distinct deposition conditions, with in situ impedance
spectroscopy enabling precise conductivity measurements without ambient
exposure. We systematically correlate deposition temperature, background
pressure, chemical composition, crystallinity, and morphology with ionic
transport properties. Polycrystalline LGPO films grown at high temperature (535
$^\circ$C) and low oxygen pressure (0.01 mbar) exhibited the highest
room-temperature ionic conductivity ($\sim 1.2 \times 10^{-5}$ S cm$^{-1}$),
exceeding that of LiPON by an order of magnitude, with an activation energy of
0.46 eV. In contrast, amorphous films show significantly lower conductivity
($\sim 5.2 \times 10^{-8}$ S cm$^{-1}$) and higher activation energy (0.72 eV).
The results reveal that crystallinity, chemical composition, and grain boundary
density critically affect ion transport, highlighting the importance of
microstructural control. This work establishes LGPO as a viable,
high-performance oxide SSE compatible with high-temperature processing for
next-generation microbattery architectures.

Conclusion: Mu的扩散特性可用于探测金刚石晶格中的缺陷中心，为研究半导体材料中的缺陷提供新方法。

Abstract: Muonium (Mu), a bound state of a positively charged muon and an electron, can
diffuse through crystal lattices and interact with defect centers in insulators
and semiconductors. We demonstrate that this Mu's diffusive property can be
used to probe defects in a diamond crystal lattice; specifically,
substitutional nitrogen atoms (N$_\text{s}^0$) and nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
centers in type-Ib diamond. Upon interaction with these defects, Mu can
exchange its electron's spin or change its charge state, which result in muon
spin relaxation. However, muons in diamond (and semiconductors in general) can
be in a few distinctive muonium states, with each state contributing to the
muon signal. In addition, these states can undergo site and charge exchange
interaction, forming a dynamic network. Hence, to study the Mu interaction with
point defects, the muon data have to be deconvoluted to isolate signals from
the diffusing species. To achieve this goal, we have modeled the Mu state
exchange dynamics and numerically simulated the time evolution of muon spin
polarization by the density matrix method. With a global curve fit to a set of
longitudinal field scan data, one can extract the Mu transition rates that
involve interaction with the defect centers. The diffusing tetrahedral
interstitial Mu was found to interact with the paramagnetic N$_\text{s}^0$
center via electron spin exchange. In contrast, they are converted to form a
diamagnetic center upon interaction with the negatively charged NV center.

Conclusion: 该方法为预测电池阴极性能提供了更高效的理论工具，有助于优化材料设计。

Abstract: Layered transition metal oxides (TMO) are widely used as cathode materials in
Na/Li batteries. The open-circuit voltage (OCV), which determines the energy
density (together with capacity), is among the key physical and chemical
factors influencing the performance of cathodes. The shape of the voltage
profile is also influenced by the formation energy of intermediate phases
during cycling. From a theoretical perspective, the formation energy (and
voltage) are defined as internal energy differences between phases. Therefore,
an accurate prediction of internal energy is crucial for the calculation of
OCV. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that decomposes the
internal energy of a given TMO into distinct contributions with clear physical
significance. Specifically, we break down the energy into parameters that can
be more easily calculated (compared to DFT) and obtained from experimental
databases. From these parameters, we define a potential term that can be
calculated for different compositions, and can be used for calculation of
voltage profile

Abstract: We propose a theoretical approach for predicting thermodynamics and kinetics
of guest molecules in nanoporous materials. This statistical mechanical-based
method requires a minimal set of physical parameters that may originate from
experiments or numerical simulations. We applied it to CO2 molecules in the
recently highlighted CALF-20 metal-organic framework for adsorption and
molecular self-diffusion at different temperatures. All the physical parameters
of the model are extracted from one CO$_2$ isotherm analyzed by the adsorption
energy distribution method. The model is then used to approximate isotherms at
different temperatures, Henry's constant, saturation density, as well as
enthalpies of adsorption at infinite dilution. We then express molecular
kinetics through the transition state theory allowing to predict molecular
diffusion in part from the prior knowledge of thermodynamics, and further
compared self-diffusion coefficients to one from molecular dynamics used as a
numerical experiment. The approach proposed allows to express molecular
adsorption and diffusion based on a fitting procedure allowing to get physical
parameters with a view on thermodynamics and kinetics mechanisms at play in the
system.

Conclusion: 纳米颗粒和DBSA浓度对PEDOT复合材料的导电性和结构有重要影响，为优化材料性能提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Composite materials based on Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and
CoFe$_2$O$_4$ magnetic nanoparticles (NP) were synthesized by chemical
oxidative polymerization with varying monomer and surfactant (DBSA)
concentrations, and were compared to PEDOT samples synthesized without NP.
Electrical conductivity measurements were performed, which revealed that the
composites are more conductive than the pure PEDOT samples, with this effect
depending on EDOT and DBSA contents. Characterizations by SEM and TEM
microscopies, UV-Vis, FTIR and Raman spectroscopies, X-ray diffraction and
dynamic light scattering were carried out in order to associate the morphology
and structure of these materials to their electrical conductivity, and to
explain how EDOT and DBSA concentrations, and also the presence of NP, affects
those properties. It was found that the NP play a significant role in the
polymerization of EDOT, influencing the formation and arrangement of polymer
chains, as well as their conjugation length, oxidation state, and resonant
structures. These effects are also dependent on the DBSA content. To describe
the conductivity of the composites, a two-phase model based on general
effective media theory was introduced. The analysis revealed that, at low
reactant concentrations, the NP increase the conductivity of the adjacent PEDOT
by over two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了阳离子环境和卤化物分布的多尺度相互作用，为优化钙钛矿相稳定性提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Lead halide perovskites (APbX$_3$) offer tunable optoelectronic properties
but feature an intricate phase-stability landscape. Here we employ on-the-fly
data collection and an equivariant message-passing neural-network potential to
perform large-scale molecular dynamics of three prototypical perovskite
systems: CsPbX$_3$, MAPbX$_3$, and FAPbX$_3$. Integrating these simulations
with the PDynA analysis toolkit, we resolve both equilibrium phase diagrams and
dynamic structural evolution under varying temperature and halide-mixing
conditions. Our findings reveal that the A-site cation strongly modulates
octahedral tilt modes and phase pathways: MA$^+$ effectively "forbids" the
beta-to-gamma transition in MAPbX$_3$ by requiring extensive molecular
rearrangements and crystal rotation, whereas the debated low-temperature phase
in FAPbX$_3$ is best represented as an Im$\bar{3}$ cubic phase with $a^+a^+a^+$
tilts. Additionally, small changes in halide composition and arrangement
$\unicode{x2013}$ from uniform mixing to partial segregation $\unicode{x2013}$
alter tilt correlations. Segregated domains can even foster anomalous tilting
modes that impede uniform phase transformations. These results highlight the
multi-scale interplay between cation environment and halide distribution,
offering a rational basis for tuning perovskite architectures toward improved
phase stability.

Abstract: We present a graphene-based memory platform built on dual-gated field-effect
transistors (GFETs). By integrating a lithographically defined metal patch
directly atop the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)-graphene channel, the device
functions simultaneously as a top gate, floating gate (FG) reservoir, and
active reset contact. This architecture forms an ultrathin van der Waals
heterostructure with strong capacitive coupling to the back-gate, confirmed by
a dynamic model, enabling a tunable and wide memory window that scales with
back-gate voltage and is further enhanced by reducing hBN thickness or
increasing FG area. Our devices demonstrate reversible, high-efficiency charge
programming, robust non-volatile behavior across 10 to 300 K and a wide range
of operation speeds, and endurance beyond 9800 cycles. Importantly, a grounded
top electrode provides on-demand charge erasure, offering functionality that is
absent in standard FG designs. These results position hBN/graphene-based GFETs
as a compact, energy-efficient platform for next-generation 2D flash memory,
with implications for multilevel memory schemes and cryogenic electronics.

Conclusion: 压力下CuO2平面电子增加、Cu-O距离缩短导致的平面内跳跃变化及Cu-3d电子库仑排斥增强等因素竞争，可能导致相变。

Abstract: Recent experimental study on Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ superconductors
has revealed an unexpected quantum phase transition from superconducting state
to insulatinglike state under pressure [Zhou et al., Nat. Phys. 18, 406
(2022)]. To better understand the physical origin of this pressure-induced
phenomenon, here we have studied the structural, electronic, and magnetic
properties of undoped and O-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi2212) under
pressures based on density-functional theory calculations. We first identified
the crystal structure of undoped Bi2212 with the armchair distortions in the
BiO layers and reproduced the insulating feature of the parent compound. Then
we added an extra O atom to the parent compound to simulate the hole-doping
effect and found that the structure with O dopant located in the van der Waals
(vdW) gap is energetically the most stable. Further calculations on O-doped
(0.125 holes/Cu) Bi2212 revealed that the pressure can induce charge
redistributions between CuO$_2$ planes and BiO layers; specifically,
Cu-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals gain electrons and Cu atoms rather than O atoms
dominate around the Fermi level under high pressure. Along with the increasing
pressure, the density of states at the Fermi level first reaches the maximum at
$\sim$ 10 GPa and then shows a valley near the Fermi level above 20 GPa, which
may be responsible for the insulatinglike state observed in recent experiments.
We suggest that the competition among several factors, such as the increase of
electrons in the CuO$_2$ plane, the variation of in-plane hopping due to the
shortened Cu-O distance, and the enhanced Coulomb repulsion among the Cu-3$d$
electrons, could lead to the exotic transition under pressure. Our work
provides an explanation of the high-pressure behaviors of Bi2212, which may
facilitate a comprehensive understanding of cuprate superconductors.

Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized bulk
$\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ has ignited significant interest
in nickelate superconductors. Unlike cuprates, where superconductivity
predominantly originates from the $\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, nickelates
exhibit additional complexities involving contributions from the
$\mathrm{3}d_{z^2}$ orbital, prompting fundamental questions about their
pairing mechanisms. Despite recent progress in stabilizing superconductivity in
$\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films at ambient pressure,
direct spectroscopic evidence of the superconducting gap opening remains
elusive. Here, we present an in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
study of Sr-doped superconducting
$\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films. Fermi surface
mapping reveals Ni-$\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$-derived $\alpha$ and $\beta$
pockets, with orbital fillings of 0.11$\pm$0.02 electrons and 0.66$\pm$0.03
holes per Ni, respectively, resulting in a total of 0.45$\pm$0.04 electrons for
each Ni. These bands exhibit moderate electron correlations, characterized by a
band renormalization factor of 3-4. Notably, both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ bands
exhibit leading-edge shifts across the superconducting transition, with gap
magnitude of ~1-2 meV at Fermi momenta along the Brillouin zone diagonal and
slightly away from the zone diagonal, deviating from the conventional
$d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap structure. Additionally, the
Ni-$\mathrm{3}d_{z^2}$-derived $\gamma$ band lies ~75 meV below the Fermi
level, indicating a $\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$-dominated fermiology in this
compound.

Abstract: A quantum state of matter that is forbidden to interact with photons and is
therefore undetectable by spectroscopic means is called a dark state. This
basic concept can be applied to condensed matter where it suggests that a whole
band of quantum states could be undetectable across a full Brillouin zone. Here
we report the discovery of such condensed matter dark states in palladium
diselenide as a model system that has two pairs of sublattices in the primitive
cell. By using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we find valence bands
that are practically unobservable over the whole Brillouin zone at any photon
energy, polarisation, and scattering plane. Our model shows that two pairs of
sublattices located at half-translation positions and related by multiple
glide-mirror symmetries make their relative quantum phases polarised into only
four kinds, three of which become dark due to double destructive interference.
This mechanism is generic to other systems with two pairs of sublattices, and
we show how the phenomena observed in cuprates, lead-halide perovskites, and
density wave systems can be resolved by the mechanism of dark states. Our
results suggest that the sublattice degree of freedom, which has been
overlooked so far, should be considered in the study of correlated phenomena
and optoelectronic characteristics.

Conclusion: 一维系统的热力学量表达式复杂，符合Mermin-Wagner定理，而二维和三维系统则显著简化。

Abstract: In this study, we present theoretical investigations of phase transitions and
critical phenomena in materials through the lens of second-order
Ginzburg-Landau theory, in conjunction with considerations of symmetry groups
and thermal fluctuations. By addressing the residual effects after a
renormalization process, a small number of macroscopic degrees of freedom can
effectively replace the infinite number of microscopic degrees of freedom,
emphasizing the significant role of dimensionality and the intrinsic
characteristics of the system in understanding and analyzing transitions. We
highlight several non-universal characteristics of continuous phase transitions
near the transition temperature, including the non-monotonic relationship
between the critical temperature and dimensionality, as well as the enhancement
or disappearance of the specific heat jump in complex superconductors. While
the resulting expressions for thermodynamic quantities are complex for
one-dimensional systems, obeying Mermin-Wagner's theorem, they are considerably
simplified for two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems.

Abstract: The transition metal dichalcogenide 4H$_{b}$-TaS$_{2}$ exhibits
characteristics of topological edge modes and two-component superconductivity
with time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB). The nature of the superconducting
order parameter is a crucial issue that requires experimental investigation.
Here, we report measurements of the magnetic penetration depth using a
tunnel-diode-oscillator based technique, as well as the specific heat. Both the
specific heat and the change in magnetic penetration depth
($\Delta$$\lambda$(T)) display an exponentially-activated temperature
dependence, providing evidence for nodeless superconductivity in
4H$_{b}$-TaS$_{2}$. Moreover, the deduced superfluid density can be well
described by a two-gap $s$-wave model, and such multigap superconductivity is
consistent with there being multiple bands crossing the Fermi energy. These
results constrain the possible pairing symmetries of 4H$_{b}$-TaS$_{2}$.

Abstract: We employ the diagrammatic Monte Carlo method with a lattice path-integral
formulation for both electron and phonon degrees of freedom to investigate the
formation and properties of bond polarons and bipolarons on a two-dimensional
triangular lattice. In the adiabatic regime ($\omega/t < 1.0$), single polarons
remain light with a small effective mass, while bipolarons remain compact and
lightweight, resulting in a high superfluid transition temperature $T_c$. We
systematically study the dependence of $T_c$ on electron-phonon coupling
strength and on-site interaction in the bond bipolaron model. Our results show
that a moderate on-site repulsion enhances $T_c$ by stabilizing compact yet
lightweight bipolarons, leading to high-$T_c$ superconductivity in the dilute
limit. Notably, the triangular lattice sustains relatively high $T_c$ across a
wide range of phonon frequencies, outperforming square lattice geometry. This
enhancement arises from the higher coordination number and the bond-centered
nature of the electron-phonon coupling. These findings suggest that triangular
lattice geometry offers a promising platform for realizing high-$T_c$
bipolaronic superconductivity.

Abstract: Over the past ten years, flat band (FB) or geometric superconductivity has
become a major issue in condensed matter physics due to the significant
technological benefits it could offer. Observations of this unconventional form
of superconductivity are unfortunately still very limited, and significant
efforts are being made to search for candidate materials. Most existing
theoretical studies focus on systems with strictly non-dispersive bands, which,
from an experimental point of view, represents an extremely difficult
technological constraint to achieve. It is therefore crucial to understand to
what extent this constraint can be relaxed. In other words, to what extent can
superconductivity in flat bands survive weak perturbations? The main objective
of the present study is precisely to answer this essential question in detail.

Abstract: We report on the temperature-dependent optical response of thin films of
YBa2Cu3O7-{\delta} (YBCO) in the visible spectral range under cryogenic
conditions. Specifically, we observe an increase in transmittance near the
superconducting transition temperature (Tc), which saturates within a few
kelvins below Tc. The increase in transmittance is accompanied by a
corresponding decrease in reflectance as the temperature drops below Tc, and
both quantities track the superconducting phase transition. Changes in
transmittance are found to be wavelength dependent, with the maximum variation
occurring at 633 nm and minimal at 450 nm. These observations establish a
correlation between the variation in optical response and the superconducting
phase transition, even in the visible regime. The results of our experiment
highlight the potential for using non-contact optical measurements to determine
Tc. The effect can be explained using the two-fluid model, which can account
for the observed temperature and wavelength dependence of the transmittance of
the superconducting thin films.

Motivation: 探索二维电子气体在强磁场下的热输运行为，尤其是填充因子ν=5/2时的热霍尔电导量子化现象，以解决实验与理论预测之间的不一致性。

Method: 结合密度矩阵重整化群（DMRG）研究物理真实的边缘结构，并通过解析计算分析边缘模式，提出Majorana边缘重构机制。

Result: Majorana边缘重构可以“屏蔽”Pfaffian或AntiPfaffian体态，使其输运特征与PH-Pfaffian态无法区分，从而解释实验观测。

Conclusion: Majorana边缘重构是一种物理自然的机制，能够合理解释实验与理论之间的差异，为理解非阿贝尔任意子激发提供了新视角。

Abstract: Pioneering thermal transport measurements on two-dimensional electron gases
in high magnetic fields have demonstrated that the quantized Hall state at
filling factor $\nu=5/2$ has a thermal Hall conductance $\kappa$ quantized in
half-integer multiples of $\kappa_0 = {\pi^2 k_B^2 T}/{3h}$. Half-integer
$\kappa/\kappa_0$ is a signature of neutral Majorana edge modes, in turn linked
to the presence of non-Abelian anyon excitations in the bulk. However, the
experimentally observed value of $\kappa$ corresponds to the 'PH-Pfaffian'
state, in tension with numerical studies which instead favor either the
Pfaffian or the AntiPfaffian. A variety of mechanisms have been invoked to
explain this discrepancy, but have been either ruled out by further experiments
or else involve fine-tuning. Building on density-matrix-renormalization group
studies of physically realistic edges and analytic calculations of edge
structure, we propose an alternative resolution of this puzzle involving an
'edge reconstruction' solely involving the neutral Majorana sector of the
theory. Such a Majorana edge reconstruction can "screen'' a Pfaffian or
AntiPfaffian bulk, so that transport signatures become indistinguishable from
those of the PH-Pfaffian. We argue that this physically natural scenario is
consistent with experiment.

Result: 激子的位移矢量独立于光偏振，且在非中心对称但非极性材料中垂直激子跃迁的位移矢量为零，而离域粒子-空穴激发的位移矢量则依赖于光偏振。

Conclusion: 激子的位移矢量是粒子-空穴激发对局域化的诊断工具，证明了电子相互作用在激发态量子几何响应中的非微扰效应。

Abstract: Excitons are a prime example of how electron interactions affect optical
response and excitation. We demonstrate that, beyond its spectra, the bound
nature of an exciton's electron-hole pair produces a correlated quantum
geometry: excitonic excitations possess a quantum shift vector that is
independent of light polarization. We find this counterintuitive behavior has
dramatic consequences for geometric response: e.g., in noncentrosymmetric but
non-polar materials, vertical excitonic transitions possess vanishing shift
vector zeroing their shift photocurrent; this contrasts with finite and
strongly light polarization dependent shift vectors for non-interacting
delocalized particle-hole excitations. This dichotomy makes shift vector a
sharp diagnostic of the pair localization properties of particle-hole
excitations and demonstrates the non-perturbative effects of electron
interactions in excited state quantum geometric response.

Result: 发现了一种与外部磁场强度无关的NLMR机制，且适用于所有中心对称点群。

Conclusion: 这种机制在拓扑和常规导体中均存在，且不依赖于朗德g因子。

Abstract: Negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NLMR) is a decrease in the
electrical resistivity of a material when the driving electric field and an
external magnetic field are collinear. In the semiclassical weak field regime,
the NLMR of non-magnetic metals is activated in the presence of substantial
concentrations of Berry curvature (BC). This restricts the appearance of a
semi-classical NLMR to metals with acentric crystalline arrangements, including
Weyl semimetals. Here, we show a previously unidentified mechanism of
semi-classical NLMR that can be present in strongly spin-orbit coupled
non-magnetic metals even if the crystal possess bulk inversion symmetry. A
Zeeman-activated BC directly couples to the orbital motion of Bloch electrons
to generate a negative MR that scales with the relaxation time precisely as the
Drude resistivity. Importantly, the Zeeman-activated BC is \emph{independent}
of the external magnetic field strength. It is instead related to the degree of
non-parabolicity of the spin-orbit coupled electronic bands. We show that this
NLMR mechanism, which is independent of the Land\'e $g$-factor, is generic and
appears in \emph{all} centrosymmetric point groups and can occur both in
topological and conventional conductors.

Abstract: Multi-exciton correlations shape the photo-induced response of nanostructured
materials, particularly when interactions are enhanced by light confinement.
Here multidimensional coherent spectroscopy is used to quantify biexciton and
exciton-polariton dynamics in a semiconductor microcavity. One- and two-quantum
spectra, which are dominated by polariton-related contributions, also include a
polarization-dependent biexciton feature whose magnitude and spectral
coordinates depend on the detuning between the cavity mode and the exciton
resonance. Comparison of spectra acquired using collinear and noncollinear
experimental geometries indicates that excitation wavevector plays no
significant role in this behavior. The measured energy dispersion and cavity
enhancement are not compatible with uncoupled biexcitons or bipolaritons. To
explain the measurements, an indirect biexciton-photon coupling model is
introduced whereby biexcitons are formed from dark excitons that Coulomb couple
to the bright-exciton fraction of the polaritons. The model addresses
inconsistent observations of biexcitons previously reported in semiconductor
microcavities and is generalizable to any material where optically dark
excitons contribute to light-matter interaction. Our results suggest a
mechanism to access long-lived dark excitons through multi-exciton correlations
in strongly coupled systems.

Motivation: 解决非平衡输运理论中的过完备性问题，并提供一种分解透射系数的方法，以更好地分析纳米器件中的电流特性。

Method: 使用VASP中的PAW方法和平面波基组，结合电流密度关系、场算符方法和非平衡格林函数形式，计算透射系数。

Result: EMT-PW与NEGF-DFT方法在周期性及非周期性边界条件下结果接近，差异源于基组、赝势和引线区域处理的不同。EMT-PW可分解透射系数并避免过完备性问题。

Conclusion: EMT-PW是一种强大的工具，可用于分析纳米器件在栅极电压下的电流特性，并为量子统计和电流量子关联研究提供了基础。

Abstract: We present an effective medium theory based on density functional theory that
is implemented in VASP using the PAW method with a plane wave basis set. The
transmission coefficient is derived through three complementary approaches: the
current density relation J=nqv, the field operator method, and the
nonquilibrium Green's function formalism. We compare transmission coefficients
calculated using EMT-PW with results from NEGF-DFT, based on the NanoDCAL
package utilizing a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis set, for
both periodic and nonperiodic boundary conditions. The minor discrepancies
observed are attributed to differences in basis sets, pseudopotentials, and the
treatment of lead regions. Notably, the EMT-PW framework avoids the common
issue of overcompleteness encountered in non-equilibrium transport theories and
allows for the decomposition of the total transmission coefficient into
contributions from individual eigenstates. Furthermore, when combined with an
effective gate model, EMT-PW is shown to be a powerful tool for analyzing
current characteristics in nanodevices under applied gate voltages. By
leveraging one-electron wavefunctions in eigenstates, this method provides a
robust foundation for exploring the quantum statistics of electrons and current
quantum correlations within the second quantization framework.

Abstract: The confinement of molecules within the van der Waals (vdW) gap between a
two-dimensional 2D material and a catalytic substrate offers a promising route
toward the development of molecule-selective catalysts with increased reaction
rates. However, identifying the kinetic limitations of such confined reactions
remains challenging. Here, we employ an inverted wedding-cake configuration of
multilayer graphene on platinum to study the dynamics of graphene etching in
the vdW gap by various molecules (O2, H2, and CO), using in situ scanning
electron microscopy. Under the experimental conditions explored (up to p =
1.4x10-3 Pa and T = 1000 {\deg}C), the etching reaction rates are limited by
mass transport within the confined space. This limitation persists even for CO,
despite its anomalously enhanced transport resulting from a significant lifting
of the vdW gap. Reactive molecular dynamics simulations further reveal multiple
etching pathways for CO, enabled by confinement within the vdW space. Once
mass-transport limitations are overcome, the vdW gap acts as an effective
nanoreactor, facilitating reaction pathways that would be otherwise
inaccessible on a pristine surface without spatial confinement.

Abstract: Edge states reflect the key physical properties yet are difficult to probe
individually, particularly when several states are present at an edge. We
present momentum resolved tunneling spectroscopy between a quantum well and a
quantum wire to extract the dispersions of the quantum Hall edge states.
Momentum and energy selective tunneling allows to separately address the
different states even if they are spatially overlapping. This delivers the edge
state velocities over broad ranges of magnetic field and density, in excellent
agreement with a hard-wall model. This technique provides a basis for future
edge state selective spectroscopy on quantum materials.

Abstract: Cavities provide a means to manipulate the optical and electronic responses
of quantum materials by selectively enhancing light-matter interaction at
specific frequencies and momenta. While cavities typically involve external
structures, exfoliated flakes of van der Waals (vdW) materials can form
intrinsic self-cavities due to their small finite dimensions, confining
electromagnetic fields into plasmonic cavity modes, characterized by
standing-wave current distributions. While cavity-enhanced phenomena are
well-studied at optical frequencies, the impact of self-cavities on nonlinear
electronic responses--such as photogalvanic currents--remains largely
unexplored, particularly in the terahertz regime, critical for emerging
ultrafast optoelectronic technologies. Here, we report a self-cavity-induced
Purcell enhancement of photogalvanic currents in the vdW semimetal WTe$_2$.
Using ultrafast optoelectronic circuitry, we measured coherent near-field THz
emission resulting from nonlinear photocurrents excited at the sample edges. We
observed enhanced emission at finite frequencies, tunable via excitation
fluence and sample geometry, which we attribute to plasmonic interference
effects controlled by the cavity boundaries. We developed an analytical theory
that captures the cavity resonance conditions and spectral response across
multiple devices. Our findings establish WTe$_2$ as a bias-free,
geometry-tunable THz emitter and demonstrate the potential of self-cavity
engineering for controlling nonlinear, nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum
materials.
